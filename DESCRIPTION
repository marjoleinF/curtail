Description: A package for creating and assessing the performance of curtailed tests. 
  A curtailed test is a variable-length test, which allows for early stopping of item
  administration when further items are unlikely or unable to change the final 
  (classification) decision. The package allows for creating and assessing 
  deterministically and stochastically (based on empirical proportions) curtailed 
  tests. In future versions of the package, model-based stochastic curtailment may be
  added. The package allows for test curtailment through the creation of look-up tables, 
  providing item-specific cut-off values for early stopping of item  administration. 
  In addition, the package allows for assessing efficiency (number of items administered 
  to arrive at a final decision) and accuracy (concordance between the final decision 
  based on curtailed and full-length test).
