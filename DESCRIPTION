Description: A package for creating and assessing the performance of curtailed tests. 
  A curtailed test is a variable-length test, which allows for early stopping of item
  administration when further items are unlikely or unable to change the final 
  (classification) decision. The package allows for creating and assessing 
  deterministically and stochastically (based on empirical proportions) curtailed 
  tests. In future versions of the package, model-based stochastic curtailment may be
  added. Curtailed tests are created by the creating look-up tables, providing a user 
  with item-specific cut-off values for early stopping of item  administration. 
  Curtailment performance is assessed in terms of efficiency (number of items 
  administered to arrive at a final decision) and accuracy (concordance of the final 
  decision based on curtailed testing with the final decision that would be obtained by
  administering the full-length test).
